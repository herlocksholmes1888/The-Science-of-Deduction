## THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION üß†

My name is John H. Watson, and I am a retired military doctor. This is a project I've been making for my flatmate. His name is Sherlock Holmes, and he is a consulting detective for Scotland Yard. 

**"The Science of Deduction"** works both as his portfolio and my personal blog. The reason is simple: a few lines from a testimony may be enough to convince some people to contact his services, but a detailed chronicle of his methods connects with a lot more people.

Find the prototype on Figma clicking [here](https://www.figma.com/design/hX2ZUrw7jskZ23YT30PTwB/The-Science-of-Deduction?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=7WnQK7B6V2kb4cIX-0) - as of right now, it is a work in progress. Don't worry about how ugly it looks, it can always get worse.

### üíª Which technologies were used to create The Science of Deduction?
- HTML, for the skeleton;
- TailwindCSS, so that the skeleton does not spook you;
- JavaScript, so that the skeleton actually does something;
- MongoDB, so that the skeleton will know what to say;
- Flask, so that the skeleton's stories can actually get to you.

### üõ†Ô∏è How do I run this locally?
Why on Earth would you do that?

First and foremost, you must create a folder in your computer and open Git Bash. Then write:

```
git clone https://github.com/herlocksholmes1888/The-Science-of-Deduction
```

In the terminal, open the project folder. For example: 

```
cd C:\Users\Watson\Documents\projects\The-Science-of-Deduction
```

Then, write one of the following commands:

```
flask run 
```

```
python app.py
```
